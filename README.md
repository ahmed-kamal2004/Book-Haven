### Approach 🚀
> My Security Architecture supports two users (Librarian as Admin and Patron as Client).
> My Approach is to use Composed userDetailsService injected into the AuthenticationProviders.
> The Architecture is open for expansion to support more types of Users. 
## Database 💿 "MySQL Relational RDBMS"
